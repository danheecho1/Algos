# 69. Sqrt(x)
Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

## Example 1: 
```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
```

## Example 2: 
```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
```

## Constraints: 
```
0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1
```

## Solution
I was not able to come up with a solution on my own. Once I read [hieven's solution and note](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/solutions/25167/easy-to-understand-javascript-solution/) saying that the square root of a number must range from 1 and x/2 + 1, I got to work. 

```js
const mySqrt = (x) => {
    let left = 1;
    let right = Math.floor(x / 2) + 1;
    let mid;
    while(left <= right) {
        mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if(mid * mid > x) {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
        else if(mid * mid < x) {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
        else {
            return mid;
        }
    }
    return right;
}
```
